    Due to the impressive advances in bio-medical imaging (fluorescence microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, endomicroscopy etc.), research
    in the life sciences has access to plenty of visual data in high resolution. Automatic processing and analysis of this data requires
    efficient and powerful image processing and machine learning algorithms.
